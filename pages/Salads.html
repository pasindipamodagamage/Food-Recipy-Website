        One thing I love: this honey mustard dressing, which I am still licking
        off my fingers as I type this. Rude. Sorry.
        <br />
        Quick question: how do we feel about fruit in salad?
        <br />
        Red grapes, blueberries, that kinda thing? I feel reeeeeal good about
        it. Like, a whole bunch of juicy fresh yum just landed right in the
        middle of my salad. Also noteworthy in this salad is the golden brown
        chicken. It was simple and delicious and you know I love a good meatless
        main, but this spice-loaded, juicy and golden brown chicken in little
        bite-sized salad pieces makes me happy (and full). Add in some crunchy
        almonds, creamy tangy feta, and the gang’s all there. Almost.
      </p>

      <h3>All Hail The Almond Honey Mustard Dressing</h3>

      <p>
        As if I need to even tell you, the crown jewel of this salad is the
        dressing. It’s like regular honey mustard but a little more
        rustic-feeling, if that can be a thing for honey mustard (lol), because
        of that almost-smooth texture that a quality almond butter adds to the
        whole thing. The thickness of the almond butter gives it an ultra creamy
        texture, plus it has the perfect sweetness of a homemade honey mustard.
        It was just superdelicious.
        <br />
        So, better question: how do we feel about lunches and
        it’s-still-light-out dinners that are easygoing and colorful and very
        delicious?

      <h3>Enjoy The Rainbow</h3>
      <p>
        For my big bowl here, I used grapes and blueberries, but you just go
        ahead and make use of whatever remnants of fruit are hanging out in your
        fruit bowl or the back of your refrigerator. Oranges? Strawberries?
        Pomegranate? No one is going to be mad about any of that.
        <br />
        There is a little bit of lettuce in the bowl to make it, well, you know,
        A SALAD, but it’s not a sad salad lettuce situation. It’s more for a
        little bite of tender-crisp greenery and dare I say I even found myself
        enjoying those bites of delicate crispness as much as the rest of it.
        Look at me go, mom.
        <br />
        The color, the crunch, the texture, the wholesomeness of all of it
        together is a straight drive into warmer weather, lighter days, and
        all-around nicer feelings.
        <br />
        Eat the rainbow and be glad.
