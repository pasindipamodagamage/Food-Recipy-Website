            This Broccoli Cheese Soup is easy, creamy, and a perfect cozy
            classic. A silky-smooth soup base, little bites of just-right
            broccoli and carrots, and some sharp creamy cheddar cheese to finish
            it off.

            There are no words to describe how delicious this soup was! I made
            it exactly according to the recipe and there wasn’t a drop left
            after my husband got a hold of it.

            Hello and welcome to your fall life.
            <br />
            I would like to campaign for you to enter into fall soup season with
            this cozy classic Broccoli Cheese Soup. It is a hug-in-a-bowl that
            is not only *easy to make* but honestly puts Panera’s version to
            shame. Ooooh yes, I said it! Listen, I truly love Panera, but
            side-by-side with this comforting pot of creaminess gently bubbling
            away on the stove, with the FRESH broccoli and carrots, and the
            glorious cheddar cheese that you ate straight off the cutting board
            shredded by hand, there is no comparing.

          <h3>Broccoli Cheese Soup Necessities</h3>
          <p>
            Broccoli cheese soup, in case you needed reminding, is going to
            bring several good things into your life: a delicate start of butter
            and garlic and onions, a silky-smooth soup base, little bite-sized
            bits of just-right broccoli, thinly sliced carrots, and a sharp,
            creamy finish from that cheddar cheese. It’s flavorful, it’s
            veg-loaded and fresh, but it’s also extremely comforting,
            unassuming, and mellow. And I think we could all use a little more
            mellow right about now, yes?
            <br />
            There’s salt, there’s pepper, and there’s paprika to season, but
            hello VERY IMPORTANT there’s also hot crusty bread for dipping.
          </p>

            If this soup isn’t the dictionary definition of fall cozy…
            <br />
            Well, there’s not even anything to say because it is. It just really
            is.
