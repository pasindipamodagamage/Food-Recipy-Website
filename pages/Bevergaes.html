                    Yield: recipe is for a 4-cup batch of simple syrup which you can
                    save in the fridge for several weeks (makes enough for about 15-20
                    drinks)

                    Everyone needs a good fancy fun mocktail in their life – especially
                    during the holidays. Herby, zingy rosemary-infused simple syrup,
                    sweet tart pomegranate juice, bubbly fizz, and fresh lime squeezes.
                    Holiday magic!

                    <li>948 ml water</li>
                    <li>800 grams sugar</li>
                    <li>
                      (2) .5 oz packages fresh rosemary (basically, a nice big bunch of
                      rosemary)
                    </li>
                    <li>optional: 4-5 whole cloves</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>59–89 ml rosemary simple syrup</li>
                    <li>59–89 ml pomegranate juice (cranberry juice is a good sub)</li>
                    <li>59–89 ml club soda</li>
                    <li>a squeeze of fresh lime (OR lime-flavored bubbly water)</li>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Heat the water, sugar, rosemary, and cloves in a saucepan over
                      medium high heat. Bring to a low boil and let everything simmer
                      for 5-10 minutes until the sugar has fully dissolved. Pour through
                      a fine mesh strainer to remove the cloves and rogue rosemary
                      leaves. Transfer to glass jars and store in the fridge for 2
                      weeks. (I often stick a sprig of rosemary in there so it keeps
                      getting more intense.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Pour your desired ratios of rosemary syrup, pomegranate juice, and
                      limey bubbly water over an ice ball into a glass. Stir gently,
                      taste and adjust, and enjoy.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                  <h2>NOTES</h2>
                  <p id="notes">
                    Garnish with a rosemary sprig or some fresh cranberries if you want
                    to be fancy! The rosemary sprig in the simple syrup will drop its
                    leaves – I usually just let them settle to the bottom and then pour
                    slowly so I don’t get rosemary leaves in my drink. (A sprig is easy
                    to drink around – but the single little needles / leaves tend to
                    slip into your mouth more easily when you’re drinking which is not
                    super pleasant.) We LOVE these ice ball molds (affiliate link) and
                    use them constantly, year-round. This can also be made with Sprite
                    or ginger ale / ginger beer in place of the bubbly water! But it
                    does get very sweet, so you may want to add extra ice to balance it
                    all out.

            <h3>Matcha Latte:</h3>
  
            <ul>
                <li>1–2 tablespoons matcha of choice – I really like the Jade Leaf matcha latte mix which is made with matcha and sugar, so it’s already a bit sweet and tastes like a coffee shop matcha latte right from the get-go, but unsweetened matcha will also work great, especially if you’d like it less sweet
                </li>
                <li>59 ml hot water
                </li>
                <li>119 to 178 ml oat milk
                </li>
            </ul>
  
            <h3>Blueberry Syrup:</h3>
  
            <ul>
                <li>222 grams frozen blueberries
                </li>
                <li>67 grams sugar
                </li>  
                <li>3 tablespoon warm water
                </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <br />
  
          <div class="INSTRUCTIONS">
            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                For the blueberry syrup: A few hours ahead of time, place the blueberries 
                in a large jar, and cover with the sugar and the water. Place the 
                jar in the fridge and let it rest for 4-6 hours or overnight to let the sugar draw some of 
                the juices out of the blueberries. When it’s done resting, give it a good stir and add a bit 
                more water if you want it less sweet. (For a faster option, you can muddle the blueberries after 
                they thaw to speed up this process, or just melt them down in the microwave and use the purple blueberry 
                juices that run off the thawed blueberries.) We’re just looking for some rich purple blueberry “syrup” 
                here – nothing too fancy!
                </li>
              <li>
                For the matcha: Heat the water in a small jar with a lid. Add the matcha powder, cover, and shake until smooth.
              </li>
              <li>Add the milk: Fill a large glass with ice. Pour the matcha over the ice, and then add the oat milk. If 
                you want to preserve distinct color layers for Instagramability, pour the oat milk over the back of a spoon.
              </li>
              <li>Finish with blueberry syrup: Finally, pour a tablespoon or two of the blueberry syrup into the glass and watch it 
                sink to the bottom (more or less to taste, but I find this is a good amount to get the blueberry flavor in 
                there without making it too sweet). Those green and purple layers are so pretty! Stir it up just before serving 
                to get the blueberry flavor in each sip!
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <br />
  
          <div>
            <h2>NOTES</h2>
            <p id="notes">
                For my matcha measurements – I’m doing about double what’s recommended on the packaging from Jade 
                Leaf so the matcha portion is a bit more concentrated. I would follow the recommendations 
                on whatever brand of matcha you are using and just increase the potency if you want it stronger!
